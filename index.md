Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) is a runtime code generation
approach. The framework provides a library of core components for
building high performance code generators and embedded compilers in
Scala.

Closely related projects are Delite, a framework for heterogeneous
parallel domain specific languages (DSLs), and Scala-Virtualized, a
set of minimal extensions to the Scala compiler to make embedding DSLs
more seamless.
