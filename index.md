Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) is a runtime code generation
approach. The framework provides a library of core components for
building high performance code generators and embedded compilers in
Scala.

Two closely related projects are Delite, a framework for domain specific 
languages (DSLs) that generates parallel code for heterogeneous devices,
and Scala-Virtualized, a set of minimal extensions to the Scala compiler 
that make embedding DSLs more seamless.
